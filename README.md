# Black-Hat-Python-Journey

As I complete BHP I will create a sort of barebones walkthrough as well as notes or tips I find important 
so that I can quickly refer back to them instead of reading through the entire text. 

Hopefully others in the community may find my notes relevant or useful if they also just want 
to skim some of the key points without digging throught the text.
